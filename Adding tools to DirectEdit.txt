"Tools" in DirectEdit are a kind of function with customizable parameters that
can be applied to native PA data structures (e.g. brushes, planet specs,
landing zones, metal spots).

To add a tool to DirectEdit, you first need to identify which kind of object
you'll be modifying and what parameters you want to use. With this information,
construct an object in the correct format and make an API call to add it to
the tool list of your choice.

You can find examples of each kind of tool under /DirectEdit/stock_tools.
You can also reference this example code, which adds a planet tool:

dEdit.api.registerPlanetTool(
	{
		// The name of this tool in the select box
		label: "Example",
		
		// The author name to display when selected
		author: "Guest",
		
		// The description to display when selected
		description: "Does something?",
		
		// A warning to display in red text when selected
		warning: "Does nothing!",
		
		// Fields required by this function; each of these will generate an input box
		// The string associated with each field will be displayed as its label
		// For convenience, all currently valid fields are given below
		// This system is subject to change in future versions
		activeFields: {
			num_angle:		"Angle (deg)",
			num_add:		"Coffee strength",
			num_mult:		"Coffee quantity",
			num_mean:		"Average sweetness",
			num_sd:			"SD of sweetness",
			num_min:		"Min creams",
			num_max:		"Max creams",
			vec_direction:	"Beans RGB",
			vec_scaling:	"Cream container dim",
			vec_translate:	"Particle velocity"
		},
		
		// This creates an instance of the tool's function with the currently set fields
		getFunction: function(fields) {
			var fn = {};
			
			fn.apoapsis = num_add;
			
			// This is the actual tool function that returns a modified version of input data
			fn.applyTo = function(planetSpec) {
				// Generally a good idea to clone first
				var cl = _.cloneDeep(planetSpec);
				
				cl.position_x = Math.round(fn.apoapsis);
				cl.position_y = 0;
				
				return cl;
			};
			
			return fn;
		}
	}
);
